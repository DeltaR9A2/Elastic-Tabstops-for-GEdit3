This is a re-implementation of the Elastic Tabstops plugin for GEdit2, which didn't seem to 
work properly in GEdit3. If the original actually does work with GEdit2, then this is just a 
port to Python cause that's worthwhile as well.

This is also kind of a "Version Zero". I've spent maybe ten hours on it total, including 
learning how to write GEdit plugins and slogging through several versions of the GTK 
documentation. It seems to be working essentially correctly; the basic elastic tabstop 
behavior is working and seems stable. It hasn't been thoroughly tested, however, and may 
behave differently than the original in some not-so-obvious ways.

Just wanted to get this out onto ye olde iternet in case anybody else is searching for it; I 
think elastic tabstops are a great idea, but it's a pain in the ass to find an editor that 
acutally implements the feature.
